Exercise taken from Chapter 3 of the book Data Structures and Algorithms in Java, 6th Edition by Michael T. Goodrich.
The application storing a sequence of high score entries for a videogame in an array.
A scoreboard is limited to a certain number of high scores that can be saved; once that limit is reached, a new score only qualifies for the scoreboard if it is strictly higher than the lowest “high score” on the board.
